## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **OpenNLPProcessor**
```java
public class OpenNLPProcessor {
    // Advanced text processing with OpenNLP
    public static ProcessedText processText(String text);
    
    // Features:
    // - OpenNLP tokenization
    // - Sentence extraction
    // - Skill context analysis
    // - Experience extraction
    // - Frequency calculation
}
```

#### 2. **EnhancedNLPMatcher**
```java
public class EnhancedNLPMatcher {
    // Enhanced matching with multiple scoring factors
    public static EnhancedMatchResult analyzeCVAndJobEnhanced(String cvText, String jobDescription);
    
    // Features:
    // - Multi-factor scoring
    // - Confidence assessment
    // - Detailed analysis
    // - Enhanced recommendations
}
```

### Scoring Algorithm

```
Overall Score = (Skill Score × 0.7) + (Experience Score × 0.3)

Where Skill Score includes:
- Base skill match (50%)
- Job importance weight (20%)
- Frequency bonus (10%)
- Context bonus (10%)
- Experience bonus (10%)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```java
// Enhanced NLP analysis
EnhancedNLPMatcher.EnhancedMatchResult result = 
    EnhancedNLPMatcher.analyzeCVAndJobEnhanced(cvText, jobDescription);

// Get comprehensive results
double matchScore = result.getOverallScore();
double confidence = result.getConfidenceScore();
List<String> matchedSkills = result.getMatchedSkills();
List<String> recommendations = result.getRecommendations();
List<String> analysis = result.getDetailedAnalysis();
```
